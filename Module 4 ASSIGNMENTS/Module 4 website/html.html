        <h2> How can we use tags to style HTML?</h2>
        <nav>
            <a href="Home.html">Home</a>
            <a href="HTML.html">HTML</a>
            <a href="CSS.html">CSS</a>
            </nav>
        <div class="home">
            <p> HTML is based on a system called tags. These tags allow you to give some basic structure to your website and align the information you need to present. While
                on its own HMTL's layout is very basic, you are able to use tags to create links, paragraphs, and show images, among many other functions. For example, in HTML 
                I can write text in this paragraph that hyperlinks to bring the user back to the <a href="Home.html">home</a> page. Below is an example of some HTML code.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="home-two">
            <p>
                Using the img tag, I am able to place an image on this webpage, although without the CSS that controls where the image is displayed and its dimensions, things would
                be much more difficult to digest. This is where UX and UI designers come in. They study the most optimal way to route a user through a website, and how to make it
                as visually appealing as possible.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <img src="example-html.png" alt="Example HTML">
   
    </body>
