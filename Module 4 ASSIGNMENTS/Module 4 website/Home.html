        <h2> An intro into  creating your own webpage</h2>
        <nav>
            <a href="Home.html">Home</a>
            <a href="HTML.html">HTML</a>
            <a href="CSS.html">CSS</a>
            </nav>
            <div class="home">
                <p >The text you are currently reading was created using HTML, a text-based coding language. All of the styling (the font, color, etc.) has been done in CSS, a separate
            language that works together with HTML to create a presentable webpage. By using tags such as h1 and h2 in HTML, we are able to emphasize certain bodies of text, and 
            then use CSS to bring it to life with elements like font-style. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="home-two">
                <p>
                    you can also use different classes and div tags in your HTML to styalize elements differently. For example, even though the paragraph to the left of this is 
                    also written using a p tag, this paragraph uses a unique class that lets me push it further to the right and change the style and font of it, without altering
                    the first paragraph. This is the power of HTML when paired with CSS.
