                <p>Most of the styling you see on this webpage was made using CSS. Without any CSS code, this webpage would simply be lines of text, with some varying size, but
                    little styling, and much more difficult to navigate. A few examples of CSS used in this website would be the changing of font color, the background color around the
                 header and the link color changing to red when you hover over it. This is only a very basic demonstration of what CSS can be used to create.

                    CSS is integral for frontend developers to master. Creating a website that feels natural to navigate is integral to keeping users engaged and allowing for easy access to 
                    whatever that website's purpose is. This is where the creative side of web development may be implemented, as it takes a certain artistic eye (one that I very clearly
                    do not posses) to make a website that appeals to all.
